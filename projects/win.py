Here’s a solid project structure to support your Windows hardening and 
monitoring system. This layout keeps things modular, maintainable, and 
scalable — whether you're running it on one machine or deploying acros
a fleet.

## 🗂️ Project Structure Overview

```

├── Scripts/
│   ├── Hardening.ps1                 # Main hardening script (disables services, configures firewall, etc.)
│   ├── MonitorServices.ps1          # WMI event watchers for critical services
│   ├── MonitorDevices.ps1           # WMI watcher for device/driver changes
│   ├── Logger.ps1                   # Central logging functions (CSV or SQLite)
│   ├── Alerts.ps1                   # Optional alerting (Event Viewer, email)
│   └── StartupTask.ps1              # Registers scheduled task to run Hardening.ps1 at boot

├── Logs/
│   ├── service_changes.csv          # Auto-updating log of service state changes
│   ├── device_changes.csv           # Log of new devices/drivers detected

## 🧠 How It All Works Together

- **Hardening.ps1**: Disables risky services, configures firewall, disables IPv6, removes unused adapters.
- **MonitorServices.ps1**: Uses WMI to watch for re-enabled services and logs/stops them.
- **MonitorDevices.ps1**: Detects new hardware or driver installs and logs them.
- **Logger.ps1**: Centralized logging functions (CSV or SQLite).
- **Alerts.ps1**: Sends alerts via Event Viewer or email when suspicious changes occur.
- **StartupTask.ps1**: Registers a scheduled task to run Hardening.ps1 at boot.

## 🛠️ Deployment Tips

- Place the entire `SystemHardening` folder in `C:\Scripts\SystemHardening` or similar.
- Run `StartupTask.ps1` once to register the boot-time execution.
- Use `Task Scheduler` or convert to a Windows Service (via NSSM) for persistent monitoring.
- Keep logs and config files in `ProgramData` or a secure location with restricted access.

Would you like me to generate the actual contents of each script file based on this structure? Or help you wire it up with SQLite and email alerts?
