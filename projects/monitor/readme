Ah! Now it‚Äôs clear ‚Äî you want **per-task interactive terminals**, almost like having a mini `tmux`/`screen` session for each running task, showing:

* Each step‚Äôs execution
* Step output / logs in real-time
* Ability to **trigger tasks independently**
* Possibly keep them alive for daemons

This changes the architecture a bit compared to a single live table. Here‚Äôs how we can approach it.

## üîπ Approaches for Per-Task Terminals in Python

### 1. **Spawn each task in a separate terminal window**

* Use `subprocess` or `os.system` to launch a terminal emulator (like `gnome-terminal`, `xterm`, `konsole`) for each task.
* Run a Python script inside that terminal that executes the task steps, prints outputs, and updates a progress bar.

Example for Linux:

```bash
gnome-terminal -- bash -c "python run_task.py --task ssh_login_monitor; exec bash"
```

* Pros:

  * Each task has its **own terminal**.
  * Easy to see logs/output in real-time.
* Cons:

  * Depends on GUI terminal emulator.
  * Harder for headless servers.

---

### 2. **TUI (Text-based User Interface) multiplexed in a single terminal**

* Use a TUI library (`urwid`, `npyscreen`, `textual`, `rich`) to create **split panes** for each task.
* Each pane acts like a mini-terminal:

  * Task name / type / status
  * Step output streaming
  * Progress bar
* Pros:

  * Single terminal for all tasks.
  * Works on headless servers (SSH).
* Cons:

  * More complex to implement.
  * Limited horizontal space for many tasks.

---

### 3. **Per-task logging + tailing**

* Each task writes output to its own log file (`/var/log/hl-monitor/<task>.log`).
* Use a separate terminal to `tail -f` the log for live output:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/hl-monitor/ssh_login_monitor.log
```

* Pros:

  * Simple, works anywhere.
  * Can monitor many tasks simultaneously using multiple terminals.
* Cons:

  * No integrated dashboard.
  * Tasks themselves don‚Äôt manage their own UI; you just monitor logs.

---

### 4. **Combination (recommended for flexibility)**

* **Tasks run as independent Python processes**, each logging to its own file.
* **Optional TUI dashboard** in main orchestrator shows overall status (like a ‚Äúmission control‚Äù).
* You can open a terminal per task (or `tmux`/`screen` pane) to watch the logs in real-time.
* **Trigger tasks independently**:

  * Orchestrator exposes a CLI: `hl-monitor run <task>` ‚Üí spawns the task process.
  * Tasks update their logs and optionally send events back to orchestrator (IPC, socket, or file).

### üîπ Proposed Architecture for Independent Task Terminals

```
                 +-------------------+
                 | Orchestrator CLI  |
                 |  - list tasks     |
                 |  - trigger task   |
                 |  - show dashboard |
                 +-------------------+
                           ‚îÇ
             +-------------+----------------+
             ‚îÇ                              ‚îÇ
      +------+-------+               +------+-------+
      | ssh_login    |               | fim_monitor  |
      | Python Task  |               | Python Task  |
      | Logs -> file |               | Logs -> file |
      | Prints steps |               | Prints steps |
      +--------------+               +--------------+
             ‚îÇ                              ‚îÇ
     Optional: tail logs / open terminal per task
```

**Execution Flow:**

1. User triggers a task (`hl-monitor run ssh_login_monitor`) from orchestrator CLI.
2. Orchestrator spawns **independent Python process**.
3. Task executes steps, prints to stdout (terminal), writes logs.
4. User can open a terminal and `tail -f` the log or see a progress bar per step.
5. Task finishes ‚Üí orchestrator updates status.

### üîπ Why This is Better for Your Case

* Each task is **self-contained** ‚Üí independent execution, restartable.
* Real-time visibility of **steps, outputs, and errors**.
* Works for one-shot, cron, or daemon tasks.
* Can be monitored in separate terminals or via a dashboard.
* Easy to extend: add new tasks by creating new Python scripts.

---

üí° **Next Step**
I can draft a **Python skeleton where:**

* Each task is its own script.
* Orchestrator CLI can: list, trigger, monitor tasks.
* Each task prints **step-by-step output with progress bars**.
* Logs go to per-task files, so you can open a terminal per task and watch live.

Do you want me to do that next?
