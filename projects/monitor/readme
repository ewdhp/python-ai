Perfect â€” we can define a **robust CLI interface** for the orchestrator that works across terminals and supports **listing tasks, running them independently, checking status, and managing logs**. This will let you use it on different terminals and trigger tasks without modifying code.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Proposed CLI Design

```
Usage: hl-monitor <command> [options]

Commands:

  list
    List all available tasks with their type (one-shot, cron, daemon) and description.

  run <task_name>
    Run a specific task in a new terminal.
    Options:
      --log PATH       Specify log file path (default: logs/<task_name>.log)
      --foreground    Run in the current terminal instead of opening a new one.

  status [task_name]
    Show the status of all tasks or a specific task.
    Options:
      --json          Output status in JSON format for automation.

  tail <task_name>
    Tail the log of a specific task in real-time.
    Options:
      --lines N       Number of lines to show initially (default: 50)

  enable <task_name>
    Enable a task if previously disabled.

  disable <task_name>
    Disable a task temporarily from being executed.

  help
    Show this help message.
```

### ðŸ”¹ CLI Behavior by Command

| Command              | Behavior                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `list`               | Reads YAML config, prints all tasks, type, description, and next scheduled run.                                          |
| `run <task>`         | Launches the task script in a **new terminal** (or foreground), logs output.                                             |
| `status`             | Reads per-task metadata (from orchestrator DB / JSON file) and prints live status: last run, next run, progress, alerts. |
| `tail <task>`        | Opens `tail -f` on taskâ€™s log file for live output.                                                                      |
| `enable` / `disable` | Updates config or DB to allow/disallow task execution.                                                                   |

### ðŸ”¹ Example Commands

```bash
# List all tasks
hl-monitor list

# Run SSH login monitor in a new terminal
hl-monitor run ssh_login_monitor

# Run FIM monitor in foreground for debugging
hl-monitor run fim_monitor --foreground

# Check status of all tasks
hl-monitor status

# Check status of one task in JSON for automation
hl-monitor status ssh_login_monitor --json

# Tail logs of a task
hl-monitor tail ssh_login_monitor --lines 100

# Temporarily disable a task
hl-monitor disable fim_monitor

# Re-enable the task
hl-monitor enable fim_monitor
```

### ðŸ”¹ Notes for Implementation

1. **Independent Terminals**:

   * Use `subprocess.Popen` to spawn `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, or `xterm`.
   * For headless servers, `--foreground` runs in current terminal.

2. **Logging**:

   * Default path: `logs/<task_name>.log`.
   * Option to override with `--log`.

3. **Status Tracking**:

   * Keep a **small SQLite DB or JSON file** storing:

     * `last_run`, `next_run`, `status`, `progress`, `alerts`, `severity`.
   * `status` command reads this file to show current info.

4. **Enable/Disable**:

   * Mark task as enabled/disabled in DB or config file.
   * Orchestrator checks this before executing a task.

5. **Extensibility**:

   * Add new commands (e.g., `cancel <task>`) without changing task scripts.
   * Works with cron-style or daemon tasks as well.

If you want, I can **draft a Python CLI skeleton** implementing these commands, integrated with **task spawning in independent terminals**, logging, and status tracking â€” ready to use on multiple terminals.

Do you want me to do that next?
