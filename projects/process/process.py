process.py
This script analyzes process logs to detect anomalous processes 
based on CPU and thread usage.

It performs the following steps:
- Loads process data from a CSV file.
- Sanitizes and normalizes numeric fields (CPU, Threads).
- Trains an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection.
- Flags trusted process paths as normal (whitelisting).
- Outputs suspicious (anomalous) processes to a separate CSV file.
Intended for use in monitoring and identifying potentially suspicious 
or abnormal processes on a Windows system.

The Isolation Forest algorithm is used here for anomaly detection. 
Its purpose is to identify processes whose CPU and Threads usage 
patterns differ significantly from the majority, which may indicate 
suspicious or abnormal behavior.

Explanation:

Isolation Forest is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm designed 
to detect anomalies (outliers) in data.It works by randomly partitioning 
the data and isolating observations. Anomalies are isolated faster because 
they are few and different.In this code, the model is trained on normalized 
CPU and Threads metrics for each process.Processes that the model predicts 
as outliers are labeled as "anomaly", while the rest are labeled as "normal".
This helps automatically flag unusual processes for further investigation.
You can add this as a comment above the model training section:
